        This is a story of <span style="color:red">red</span>riding hood. Whose grandmother
craved for <span style="color:blue">blue</span>berry pie. She traveled along the <span style="color:brown">brown</span>dusty road. Bumped across a <span style="color:grey">gray</span>wolf who then told her he
wanted some of those tasty blueberry pie. She shook her
head and told him no, which made him green with envy. He
then decided to find grandmas big purple house, and hid her
in the orange closet. But red was smarter than that and she
took a bat and knocked wolf out.
